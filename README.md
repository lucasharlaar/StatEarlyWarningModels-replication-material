# StatEarlyWarningModels-replication-material
Replication material for the paper "Statistical Early Warning Models with Applications". Replication of both applications requires the [Ox](https://www.doornik.com/doc/ox/) programming language and makes extensive use of the package '[ssfpack](https://www.doornik.com/download.html)'. 

1. The folder '[Application_1](Application_1)' contains the material corresponding to the _Trafic Safety Monitor_ study.
   - The main file is called '[SWOV_v13.ox](Application_1/SWOV_v13.ox)'.
   - Generated output and graphs are stored the folders '[Graphs_v2](Application_1/Graphs_v2)' and '[Output_v2](Application_1/Output_v2)'.
   - Additional Ox files generate tables and graphs for the real-time nowcasting exercise.
2. The folder '[Application_2](Application_2)' contains the material corresponding to the _Labour Force participation_ study.
   - The main file are called '[CBS_v12.ox](Application_2/CBS_v12.ox)' and '[CBS_v12_covid.ox](Application_2/CBS_v12_covid.ox)'.
   - Generated output and graphs are stored the folders '[Graphs_v2](Application_2/Graphs_v2)' and '[Output_v2](Application_2/Output_v2)'.
   - Additional Ox file generates graphs for the real-time nowcasting exercise.
